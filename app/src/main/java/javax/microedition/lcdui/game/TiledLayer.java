/**
 * The TiledLayer class represents a visual element composed of a grid of cells, 
 * where each cell can display a tile from a predefined set of tiles. This class 
 * is used in 2D games to create complex backgrounds or other tiled graphics 
 * efficiently.
 * 
 * <p>
 * Each cell in the grid can be empty or contain a tile. The tiles are referenced 
 * by their index in a tile set, which is typically an image containing multiple 
 * tiles of the same size.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * The TiledLayer class extends the Layer class, inheriting its properties and 
 * methods for managing the position, visibility, and other attributes of the 
 * layer.
